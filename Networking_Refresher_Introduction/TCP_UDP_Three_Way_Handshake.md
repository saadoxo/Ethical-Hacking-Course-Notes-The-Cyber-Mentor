# TCP vs UDP

## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

- Known as a **Connection-Oriented Protocol**.
- Examples: **HTTP**, **HTTPS**, **SSH**, **FTP** (File Transfer Protocol).

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

- Known as a **Connectionless Protocol**.
- Examples: **Voice-over IP (VoIP)**, **DNS**, **Streaming Services**.

## Three-Way Handshake

The **three-way handshake** is a process used in TCP to establish a connection between the client and server. It involves three steps:

1. **SYN** (Synchronize) – The client sends a request to the server to initiate a connection.
2. **SYN-ACK** (Synchronize-Acknowledge) – The server responds to the client confirming the request.
3. **ACK** (Acknowledge) – The client acknowledges the server's response, completing the handshake.

### Examples:

- **Example 1: Interaction Between Two People**
  - **Hello!** → **Waves back (Acknowledged)** → **Ready to start the conversation**

- **Example 2: Connecting to a Webpage on Port 443**
  - **Client: I want to connect to port 443** → **Webpage checks if port 443 is open, acknowledges** → **Client connects**
