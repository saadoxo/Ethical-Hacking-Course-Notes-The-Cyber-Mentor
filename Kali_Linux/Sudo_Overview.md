# Sudo Command

The **`sudo`** command is used to grant **admin access** through the terminal while staying as a **regular user**. It stands for **Super User Do**.

### Important Notes:
- You can use **`sudo su`** to switch users and gain **admin privileges permanently**. 
  - **Note**: This is not recommended for security reasons, as it gives you full admin access without the need for `sudo` each time.
  - However, it can be useful in certain situations where you need to perform multiple admin tasks quickly. You can also open a new terminal tab to make everything easier.
